## Pause when Hovering

This Processing sketch demonstrates one direct approach to pausing the motion of one object in a collection. Requirements:

* When the mouse is over a bubble, it should stop moving.
* Only one bubble can be paused at a time.
* When the mouse leaves the location of the bubble, it should resume moving.

Takes a little effort without mouseOver/mouseOut event handlers.
